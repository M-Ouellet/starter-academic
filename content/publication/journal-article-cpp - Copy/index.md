abstract: This study uses dynamic network models to assess the role of an officer's colleagues on their propensity to use their firearm during a force encounter. The findings extend past scholarship by 1) testing whether firearm use is a socially transmitted behavior, 2) investigationg overlooked forms of firearm use - drawing and pointing a firearm, and 3) applying statistical models that allow us to control for situational and other confounding characteristics of firearm incidents.
