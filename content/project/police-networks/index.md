Police officers’ informal relationships and workplace interactions often guide police work. As well, organizational hierarchy shapes officers’ daily interactions through their rank, assignments, and partnerships. By studying police networks, insight can be gained into the social structure of departments, organizational cohesion and fragmentation, and the consequences of network structures on the diffusion of behaviors and attitudes. This project investigates the dynamics of police networks on the social transmission of police behavior.
