This project integrates recent advances from two strands of inquiry – space-time visualization techniques and network science - to advance the visualization and analysis of crime in urban cities. Our work thus far has advanced the development of a dynamic visualization tool—the Interaction Geography Slicer-which draws from detailed arrest records to consider the ways offenders and police officers connect urban space. Our work will continue to advance this line of inquiry by bridging network and spatial scholarship to explore how criminal networks and policing activity shape the spatial distribution of crime. We believe these advancements can, and should, play a role in police reform to improve police-community relations, shed insight into the diffusion and displacement of crime, and lead to new questions and insights not observable through traditional analytic techniques.

This project is in collaboration with Benjamin Shapiro, Assistant Professor at Georgia State University. https://www.benrydal.com/
