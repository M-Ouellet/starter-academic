This project leverages digital trace data collected from cryptomarkets and forums involved in the sale of stolen data to identify how illicit marketplaces are connected, along with the role of peers in shaping online trajectories. Specifically, it compiles and analyzes a longtiudinal dataset of stolen data products across digital marketplaces on the darkweb and other online platforms, such as the Telegram app. This project was funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Grant Award Number 17STCIN00001-05-00. The views and conclusions contained in this project are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
